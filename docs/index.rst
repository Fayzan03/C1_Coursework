Automatic Differentiation using Dual Numbers - documentation
============================================================

This is the documentation for the **dual_autodiff** package.
The ``dual_autodiff`` package is a simple Python package that implements automatic differentiation using dual numbers.
The particular method used for computing the derivative is known as forward mode automatic differentiation.
Automatic differentiation has a wide variety of uses in machine learning and optimisation, in particular within deep neural networks. 


Features
========
 - **Dual class:** Core attributes and methods. It is used to create dual numbers and implement arithmetic operations on them as well as some common mathematical functions.

For an example of how to differentiate a function using the **dual_autodiff** package, see the tutorial notebook below.
