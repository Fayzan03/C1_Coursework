Automatic Differentiation using Dual Numbers - documentation
============================================================

This is the documentation for the **dual_autodiff** package.
The ``dual_autodiff`` package is a simple Python package that implements automatic differentiation using dual numbers.
The particular method used for computing the derivative is known as forward mode automatic differentiation.
Automatic differentiation has a wide variety of uses in machine learning and optimisation, in particular within deep neural networks.
